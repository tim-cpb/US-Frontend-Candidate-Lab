## CP+B Candidate Lab

Congratulations! If you've made it this far, we like you already.
This lab is an opportunity for us to have a conversation about practices, conventions, and workflow.
It will also help us better understand you as a developer. 
Please use this as a way to communicate through your craft.


# Setup

1. Fork this repo and clone to your computer
2. Setup the project in your prefered IDE
3. View index.html in the browser (/www)
4. Open the psd file in /psd (/psd)


# Development

* Improve semantic structure and content of the HTML
* Incorporate missing design elements (per psd)
* Create an RSVP message onClick of 'Yes' or 'No':
  ** Provide feeback to the user with confirmation of their choice
  ** Design, behavior, and messaging are up to you
  ** Plug-ins, libraries, and frameworks are permitted
* Modify anything and everything you think should be different/improved. Document the reasoning for your changes in the Notes section.


# Workflow

Please make atomic commits (commit often) as you progress. 
Be sure to provide useful commit messages to illustrate milestones and workflow.
Submit a pull request when you are finished and satisfied with your work.

# Notes
